On this episode of GrippingGolf, Billy and Daniel discuss the Rory McIlroy and Brook Koepka ongoing feud. Is there really a rivalry between the two PGA Tour professionals. Also, the boys discuss their favorite major tournament.

Brooks Koepka and Rory McIlroy have clearly identified themselves as two of the elite PGA Tour players in the last few years. Is there really a rivalry between the two players or is the media over hyping it? Koepka is a straightforward guy, just like GrippingGolf podcast, and its seems the media is trying to drive a wedge, no pun intended, between the two players.
