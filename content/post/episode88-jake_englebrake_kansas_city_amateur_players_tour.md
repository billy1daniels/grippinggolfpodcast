## Amateur Players Tour

The Amateur Players Tour is a members-only international golf society consisting of Local Chapters organized throughout the United States and Canada for men and women of all ages and skill levels who love the game of golf, enjoy participating in various competitive golf tournament formats, love to travel to play at new golf courses and facilities around the country, and desire fellowship on and off the golf course with other golf fanatics who can’t get enough of the game, its history, its architecture, and its spirit.
</br>
We created the APT to improve upon the repetitive stroke play experience common among the various am tour companies out there.  One way we are doing so is infusing elements of the private club experience into our model by changing up the tournament formats to include match play, Stableford scoring, team event formats, member-guest events, and more.  Our focus is always on the player experience with a heavy emphasis on fun and friendly competition.
</br>
While the Local Chapter events are the heart and soul of our society’s calendar with a healthy schedule in your local area with competitive entry fees, the APT also provides its members with opportunities for higher end, more exclusive experiences at some of the nation’s top golf resorts and private clubs.  These events are hosted and operated by the national office and open to entry by any member of the Tour.
</br>
Our inaugural North American Championship will be held in October, 2021 at the historic Pinehurst Resort in Pinehurst, North Carolina.  Members from all over the continent will converge on Pinehurst to play a 54-hole stroke play tournament to crown Champion Golfers of the Year in all Divisions.  We are excited to introduce a new format to our North American Championship that will provide each competitor in the field, regardless of their Division, to earn the opportunity to play their final round on the storied Pinehurst No. 2!
</br>
The Amateur Players Tour pledges to rotate our North American Championship to a new and fantastic host venue each year to give all of our members an opportunity to host and play in the season championship in their own backyard.  Whether your accustomed to playing at altitude or at sea level, on Bermuda or bentgrass, on tree-lined fairways or open, rolling terrain, our North American Championship will provide every member an equal opportunity to compete for the crown.
</br>
We encourage you to reach out to the Local Chapter Owner in your area to find out more about how you can become a part of the APT brotherhood and get more out of your tournament golf experience.
