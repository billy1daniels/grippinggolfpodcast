Pressure Putt Trainer
With a scientifically shaped parabolic ramp, each 'made' putt is returned to the player the same distance it would have gone past the hole had it missed, anything else is a miss.

Only putts of absolute perfection will hold in the micro-target, so let the practice begin.

Perfect Putt
Only a ball that is rolled on the perfect line and with the perfect pace (18-inches past the hole had it missed) will stick in the PuttOUT micro-target. Think you can putt to absolute perfection?

Alignment Setup
The first new development of the new Trainer is the addition of an alignment stick holder towards the top of the Trainer’s ramp. The feature acts as a rubber grip for a soon-to-be-released Putting Plane Alignment Stick Set, but can also be paired with the player’s existing alignment stick setup, replicating the 'String Drill.'

Multiple Targets
The three smaller dot targets allow the player to focus in and use them either as another common target — especially for those who prefer to aim towards the back of the cup on putts, but can also be used to allow the player to adjust to slight breaks of the putting surface in their practice.
