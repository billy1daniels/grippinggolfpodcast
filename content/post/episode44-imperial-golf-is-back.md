## Imperial Golf
Imperial golf was started in 2013 as a stand alone golf facility here in Parkville, MO.  With a lot hard work and perseverance we were able to grow the business through word of mouth based on a stellar reputation for eye opening instruction.  Over the last few years our vision has been and still remains to impact the world of golf on a major scale.  The renovation in February, 2017 was the first major step in the direction of growth for Imperial Golf.  Creating a one of a kind purpose built facility that encompass' all aspects of the game of golf to further benefit our students and help mold a better game tee to green.  With hard work and determination we are now poised to grow the brand of Imperial Golf.  

### Why Imperial Golf? 

We wanted a name that would separate us from all other instruction as well as a name that was diverse enough to be applied to other areas of the golf industry.  Instruction is just the beginning for Imperial Golf and we feel with our knowledge and professionalism we'll be able to branch out into others areas within the world of golf. 

### Why get rid of the "academy" name?  

Our vision initially was to create something that was less regional so that when we start expanding beyond our current location the transition would be less complicated.  Further more, in the world of changing golf retailers and club companies our role within the golf industry has yet to be defined. We are excited to find out what opportunities await us!
