## Stripe Golf Co.™

Founded in the summer of 2020 by three friends in Kansas City.

To most golfers, golf is more than just a game -- it's a lifestyle. With that in mind, they aim to deliver premium style and comfort both on and off the course. 

As the culture of golf moves further away from polos and slacks and closer to hoodies and joggers, Stripe Golf Co.™ is at the forefront of that style shift.

Their goal is to make you want to wear your golf gear everywhere, not just on the course.
