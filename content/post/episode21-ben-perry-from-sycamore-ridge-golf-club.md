On this episode of GrippingGolf, Billy and Daniel chat with Ben Perry, Sycamore Ridge Golf Club General Manager. Ben, Billy and Daniel talk about the state of the game, how they each got started in golf and where they think the game is going.

## Sycamore Ridge Golf Club

The bentgrass fairways and greens – first to turn emerald in the spring, last to lose their lush beauty in the fall – are just the beginning. Sycamore Ridge is like two superb golf courses in one. The steep, wooded hillsides, valleys and streams of the front nine lead you to the gently rolling, links-style back nine.

Sycamore Ridge has earned its reputation as one of Kansas City’s premier public golf courses with its stunning combination of bent grass, white sand bunkers and 18 holes of exciting and challenging play. From the elevated, wooded hills of its front nine to the gently rolling back nine, Sycamore Ridge has golfers coming back again and again. Destined to become the tourism destination for golfers throughout the region, Sycamore Ridge Golf Club never fails to please.
