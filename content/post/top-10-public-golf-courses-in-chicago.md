by T.J. Sullivan

My personal criteria for a great golf course is relatively simple: tee boxes that are relatively flat, greens that roll true (they don’t need to be insanely fast) and a layout that is challenging and doesn’t take driver out of your hand due to funky hazards – in my opinion when architects do that, I believe it’s lazy.

## 10. **VILLAGE GREENS OF WOODRIDGE**

[1575 75th St, Woodridge, IL 60517](https://g.page/VillageGreensGolf?share)

The Village Greens of Woodridge is the first of two sentimental picks on this list. Village Greens offers a challenging golf courses and packages in a beautiful natural setting in Woodridge, Illinois. The staff is wonderful and course is always fair and true.

I particularly like the home stretch of 15-18. 15 is a getable par 4 with water down the right side of the fairway for the tee shot. 16 is a strong dog-leg left with a large tree overhanging the front right portion of the green. The par-3 17th is a very fun tee shot in the evening, but make sure you are on the correct side of the green as it is large and undulating. The finishing hole 18th is one of my favorites, a true risk reward finishing dogleg left. Try to cut the corner and run the risk of a bunker, trees, or even some OB. Bail out to the right and you will have a very long second and third shot into this uphill par 5.

If you’ve never played there, you’re missing a great round of golf.

## 9. **PALATINE HILLS GOLF COURSE**

[512 W Northwest Hwy, Palatine, IL 60067](https://g.page/palatinehills?share)

The par 72 course has four sets of tees that provide a challenging yet enjoyable experience for golfers of all skill levels.

The layout requires golfers to use all the clubs in the bag during a round. The par 4 holes range in distance from 335 to 456 yards and par 3 holes range from 165 to 228 yards. In addition, players must contend with 29 bunkers and water that comes into play on 10 holes.

One of the few courses in the Chicago-land area where you really have to judge elevation changes on several of the holes. The par 5’s really set this course apart, while fair, the tee shots can be very demanding. If you have a good driver day, the course is very fun. However, if you have a bad driving day, get your punch shots ready, you will need it!

## 8. **PRAIRIE BLUFF GOLF COURSE**

[19433 Renwick Rd, Lockport, IL 60441](https://goo.gl/maps/654zBpm2ynVaQGk2A)

The golf course at Prairie Bluff features an 18-hole championship designed course decorated with water, prairie grass and manicured bent grass fairways.

Prairie Bluff is 7,007 yards long, but seems much longer covering more than 230 acres with a practice putting green, short game area with bunker and a ten acre driving range.

Prairie Bluff Golf Club is the perfect location to host your next golf outing. Whether you have a group of 16 or 144, Prairie Bluff Golf Club’s expertly manicured golf course and beautiful clubhouse will not only meet your outing expectations but will exceed them. When you choose Prairie Bluff for your next golf outing, you will work with a staff that is dedicated to making your golf outing an enjoyable and memorable experience.

Even on calm days, this course can be pretty windy. But if you play early in the morning like I usually do, it can be fantastic. Try to get there in the fall to see the fescue grass all through the course, just don’t get too close otherwise your ball may be gone forever.

9 and 18 surround a pond that you have to navigate well otherwise it could really challenge a nice score for either side of the course.

## 7. **MOUNT PROSPECT GOLF CLUB**

[600 S See Gwun Ave, Mount Prospect, IL 60056](https://goo.gl/maps/JFgM57hswAhBJXRW6)

In an effort to recover the traditional design values of the game, Esler Golf Design renovated Mt. Prospect Golf Club and restored the course to its 1926 origins in a style consistent with one of the most famous Golden Age architects, Seth Raynor. Raynor designed renowned clubs like Fisher Island, Fox Chapel, Chicago Golf and Shoreacres. He was famous for his use of “template holes” in each of his designs which matched great golf holes throughout Britain. Each hole is appropriately named from its origin such as the Redan, Eden, Cape, Punchbowl, and Biarritz. All of these holes are represented in the redesign of Mt. Prospect Golf Club.

Home to one of the best practice putting greens in the state, the course in its new redesign doesn’t let down. I especially like the start of the back 9 with a unique par 3 10th, and a long par 4 11th that bends a little to the right over water.

## 6. **ORCHARD VALLEY GOLF COURSE**

[2411 W Illinois Ave, Aurora, IL 60506](https://goo.gl/maps/wbycJTHzc8xyFZ637)

One of Chicagoland’s top five courses, Orchard Valley Golf Course is an 18-hole, 6,800-yard, par-72 championship layout open to the public.

Featuring four sets of tees, this beautiful course offers the appropriate challenge to all skill levels. Orchard Valley has been distinguished by Golf Digest Magazine as a 4 1⁄2 star facility.

Home to perhaps the best 2nd hole in all of Chicagoland golf. A long par 3 with water all down the right side gets your blood flowing early in the round. Then it doesn’t let up with the same water hazard down the right side of the par 4 3rd and par 5 4th. Some of the best opening holes and a great facility to warm up with. The 19th hole also has a great scenery overlooking the 18th green.

## 5. **BOLINGBROOK GOLF CLUB**

[2001 Rodeo Dr, Bolingbrook, IL 60490](https://goo.gl/maps/Cv3F361vwwkAoopD8)

Just an hour outside of Chicago in the picturesque village of Bolingbrook, the 18-hole championship golf course at Bolingbrook Golf Club offers golfers the chance to come test their hand at a beautiful design by Arthur Hills and Steve Forrest.

As scenic as it is a joy to play, the course provides magnificent photo opportunities at every hole. Elevated tees, rolling fairways and seven lakes are scattered throughout the layout, which includes a true island green par 3 and a 600-yard par 5.

In addition to world-class golf, Bolingbrook offers an array of excellent amenities — from The Nest Bar and Grill, complete with daily food and beverage specials, to professional golf fittings and top-of-the-line equipment in our pro shop.

The course itself is wonderful, but it’s one of a few golf courses that has 2 practice holes. If you have an afternoon tee time, you definitely want to get there early in the morning to work your way around the range to the amazing practice facility. I highly recommend tying your hat to your head because as windy as some other courses get, the wind at Bolingbrook usually has a fan behind it.

The true island green par 3 15, and the 600-yard par 5 5th hole are simply amazing holes but shouldn’t take away from the other holes on the course that are very scenic. My favorite hole on the whole course is the par 3 8th that has a wall with “BOLINGBROOK” on it. Deceptively long, with a hazard to carry and bunker long is a tough test to get things finishing on the front 9.

## 4. **CANTIGNY GOLF**

[27W270 Mack Rd, Wheaton, IL 60189](https://goo.gl/maps/CPb3uguLg9mnXTkYA)

Cantigny Golf offers 27-holes of championship golf. It is comprised of the Woodside, Lakeside and Hillside courses. Together the courses create three unique golf experiences. Cantigny Golf has been host to the 2007 U.S. Amateur Public Links, the 1998 and 2002 Illinois Amateur Championship and numerous USGA qualifiers.

Cantigny Golf, owned by the Robert R. McCormick Foundation and managed by KemperSports, is widely regarded as one of the finest public golf facilities in the Midwest. Whether you’re playing a casual 9 or 18, practicing at the Academy, enjoying a meal hosting an all-day golf outing, Cantigny Golf is a great spot to be.

One of my favorite holes is the par 4 6th on Hillside. Coming out of a traditional shoot with trees overhanging the back tee box and even more demanding as there is water left and right. A long iron would be a smart play, but the long hole calls for driver off the tee. The second shot is no piece of cake either. With a two tier green and water surrounding, this is a shot you definitely want to take extra caution.

## 3. **COG HILL GOLF & COUNTRY CLUB - DUBSDREAD**

[12294 Archer Ave, Palos Park, IL 60439](https://goo.gl/maps/wGokKwX197JWwfUy5)

Known as the “Patriarch of Public Golf,” Joe Jemsek always aspired to provide a country club experience and amenities to all golfers. Even with three highly successful golf courses, Joe was still concerned that he didn’t have a course to better the finest country clubs in the United States. Once again Joe partnered with the famed golf architect team of Dick Wilson (Bay Hill, Cog Hill No.3, Doral-Blue Course, Laurel Valley) and Joe Lee (Bent Tree, Palm Beach National, La Costa, Walt Disney World Courses) to create Joe’s vision of a fourth course, one that would test the world’s greatest golfers. Wilson/Lee complied and created what many consider to be each architect’s best work.

The collaboration such a successful one, No. 4 has remained nationally ranked since its opening in 1964. Course No. 4 or “DUBSDREAD” as commonly referred to, was derived from the idea that a “dub” or poor golfer should beware and served as a warning of the challenges forthcoming. True to its name, this natural-style championship course places a high demand on shot-making ability by providing tight landing areas combined with heavily bunkered, large undulating greens.

Over the years, DUBSDREAD has challenged professionals and amateurs alike while hosting numerous PGA Tour and USGA tournaments.

I still remember as a kid parking in a large field with my dad and going to the 15th green to watch Tiger Woods come up the fairway and finish the Western Open. I get all the feels around that hole knowing that the greatest golfer of all time stepped foot exactly where I was walking. This is the second sentimental pick because of that history Dubs brings.

## 1. **THE HIGHLANDS OF ELGIN GOLF COURSE**

[875 Sports Way, Elgin, IL 60123](https://goo.gl/maps/t6WjKT8YwVekLQhw8)

The Highlands of Elgin has become a premier destination for thousands of golfers throughout the region. Nine new holes reclaim an old stone quarry, and take maximum advantage of the unique and dramatic landforms that were left behind, including a twelve acre quarry lake. Four holes hug the top of the bluff thirty to forty feet above the water providing golfers with incredible views and numerous shot options on each hole. The original nine holes flow over beautiful rolling terrain, creating a diverse collection of holes. The prairie style clubhouse features an expanded golf shop, locker rooms, event rooms and a full scale food and beverage operation. The facility also features a lighted practice facility offering bent grass tees, 20 hitting stations, short game area and a 9,000 sq. ft putting green.

Perhaps the best all around facility in Chicagoland. The range, putting green, course, amenities, service, everything is top notch. From the opening tee shot downhill on the first to the first par 3 down the quarry, to the finishing holes, this course makes you think and incentives great ball striking.

The Highlands of Elgin is a must play for everyone every year.
