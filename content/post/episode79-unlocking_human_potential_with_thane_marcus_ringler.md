## The 5 Voices

### Here's the big idea...
Everyone has a leadership voice, whether they know it or not. From the most quiet to the most gregarious, we all have the ability to lead others.

### The problem is...
Most people don’t know their leadership voice or how to use it. Some don’t know what it is, others are insecure in their voice and have been told it is unimportant, and others immaturely overuse their voice and dominate the airwaves.

### Welcome to the 5 Voices...
The 5 Voices is designed to help every individual discover their leadership voice and be empowered to use it effectively.

We believe teams and whole organizations can be transformed when everyone operates securely in their own voice and learns to value the voices of others.
