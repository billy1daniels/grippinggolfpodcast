Developed by PGA professional golfer Mark Sweeney, Aimpoint Putting is a method of reading and interpreting greens that uses the player's body movement to feel the slope of the green, rather than just relying on visual cues. This unique approach can help to eliminate some of the common problems golfers face when putting.

One of the biggest issues golfers encounter on the greens is misreading the slope of the green. This can lead to missed putts and a higher score on the hole. With Aimpoint Putting, golfers use their body movement to sense the slope of the green and make adjustments to their aim and stroke accordingly. This helps to improve accuracy and consistency on the greens.

Another problem golfers often face is overthinking on the greens. It's easy to get caught up in trying to read every little break and undulation on the green, which can lead to a loss of focus and confidence. With Aimpoint Putting, golfers are able to simplify their process and focus on the bigger picture, which can help to reduce tension and increase confidence on the greens.



## How to use Aimpoint Putting effectively:

1. Begin by studying the green and identifying the high and low points.
2. Set up to your putt with your body parallel to the slope of the green.
3. Use your body movement to sense the slope of the green and make adjustments to your aim and stroke accordingly.
4. Practice this technique consistently to improve your accuracy and consistency on the greens.

In conclusion, Aimpoint Putting is a valuable tool for any golfer looking to improve their putting game. However, it's important to note that it may not be suitable for every golfer. Let's take a look at the pros and cons of this method:


## Pros:

* Helps to eliminate common problems such as misreading the slope of the green and overthinking

* Simplifies the putting process and increases confidence on the greens




## Cons:

* It may take some time for golfers to fully grasp and implement the technique

It's worth mentioning that many professional golfers on the PGA Tour have adopted Aimpoint Putting, including players like Matt Kuchar, Jason Day, and Kevin Kisner. They have seen the benefits of this method and have incorporated it into their game.

In any case, it's worth giving it a try and see how it works for you and your game.
