He was a team captain in 2013 and 2014 and helped lead the Wildcats to back-to-back Heart of America Athletic Conference Tournament Runner-Up finishes.

The Wildcats won five-straight tournaments his senior season and he finished individually in the Top 5 in over 15 tournaments in his four-years with the program.

This past 2017-18 golf season, Kelley served as assistant golf coach alongside coach Exon.

Kelley also served an integral role in the success of the BU women's basketball program from 2014-17, as he served as a graduate assistant under head coach Ben Lister for two seasons and then in his final season as an assistant coach.

The Wildcats had unprecedented success in those three seasons, as they posted a 79-24 record with two trips to the NAIA National Quarterfinals and the programs first-ever appearance in the NAIA National Championship game in 2016.

Baker was honored with several individual awards as well on the hardwood, including four NAIA All-Americans, 10 Heart All-Conference award winners, as well as Heart Defensive Player of the Year and Heart Player of the Year.
