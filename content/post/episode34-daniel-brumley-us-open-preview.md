On this episode of GrippingGolf, Daniel and Billy get back in the studio together. Listen in and hear what they've been doing and what they think will happen in the US Open at Winged Foot.

## 120th U.S. Open Championship
Winged Foot Golf Club, Mamaroneck, N.Y., Sept. 14-20, 2020

Winged Foot has a storied history of hosting national championship golf on our two Albert W. Tillinghast-designed courses. We have hosted five U.S. Opens, the 1940 U.S. Amateur, the 1949 Walker Cup, and a PGA Championship on our West Course. We are most excited about the U.S. Open to be played at Winged Foot in 2020. Our East Course has been the site of two U.S. Women's Opens and the inaugural U.S. Senior Open. The 2004 U.S. Amateur was played over both courses.

### Winged Foot Golf Club
The building of the golf courses must have caused a stir of excitement back then. Winged Foot had sought out the best. A. W. Tillinghast, one of the most prominent golf architects of the day, was hired to build the courses. Also hired was respected clubhouse architect Clifford Wendehack to build a clubhouse in the style of Tudor Scholastic.

Shortly after the club opened, Winged Foot appointed top player Mike Brady its pro. Brady finished second in the 1911 and 1919 U.S. Open Championships.

The initial charter members came from the NYAC. And we can imagine that informed local golfers were following every stage of the development and walking the grounds surveying the raw layout. Celebrity memberships followed. John Anderson, who had finished second twice in the U.S. Amateur, joined in 1924, shortly after the course was completed. Jess Sweetser, 1922 U.S. Amateur champion and runner-up in 1923, also joined in 1924. Other top golfers in the area migrated from their clubs and sought membership at Winged Foot. The club became recognized nationally when the USGA awarded the 1929 U.S. Open to Winged Foot West. It took only six years for Winged Foot to be selected by the USGA to hold an Open. To this day, Winged Foot West is “the youngest” course in history to be so honored.

Winged Foot Golf Club is admired around the world as one of the world’s greatest Golf Clubs. The Founders had such a remarkable vision for the Club which was founded in 1921.

Not one, but two of the greatest golf courses in the world designed by A. W. Tillinghast. The Founders wanted two exceptional golf courses, a rather bold undertaking for the times. Starting in 1929, the Club has hosted major golf events. Since their opening, both golf courses have been recognized both individually and collectively. The West Course has consistently ranked in the Golf Digest Top 10 in the United States. Winged Foot Golf Club is the only golf club in the world with both courses ranked in the Top 100 worldwide. Our courses are maintained to meet and exceed championship standards.

In 1929 Winged Foot Golf Club hosted its first US Open. Since then the Club has hosted four more USGA National Championships, the 1997 PGA Championship, two Women’s Opens, a Senior Open and two U.S. Amateurs and the 2016 U.S. Amateur Four Ball. In June of 2020 we will host our sixth USGA National Championship. There are few clubs in the world with Winged Foot’s history of hosting major golf events.
