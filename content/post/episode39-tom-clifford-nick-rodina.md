description = "On this episode, Tom Clifford and Nick Rodina. Nick and Tom are both long time members of Sycamore Ridge Golf Club, and I have spent some time with them lately at the golf course. Though itâ€™s not a lot of time, I can say they are two of the biggest ambassadors of Sycamore Ridge Golf Club but more importantly to the game of golf. Their positivity and support towards others inside and outside the game of golf is second to none, and for that I thank them both. Please welcome to the show Tom Clifford and Nick Rodina."
