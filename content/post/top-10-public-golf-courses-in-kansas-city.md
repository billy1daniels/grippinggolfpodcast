## 1. Sycamore Ridge Golf Course

Bentgrass tees, fairways and greens – first to turn emerald in the spring, last to lose their lush beauty in the fall – are just the beginning. Sycamore Ridge is like two superb golf courses in one. The steep, wooded hillsides, valleys and streams of the front nine lead you to the gently rolling, links-style back nine.

Sycamore Ridge has earned its reputation as one of Kansas City’s premier public golf courses with its stunning combination of bent grass, white sand bunkers and 18 holes of exciting and challenging play. Destined to become the tourism destination for golfers throughout the region, Sycamore Ridge Golf Club never fails to please. It's no wonder Sycamore Ridge has golfers coming back again and again.

The full experience challenges your skills even as it calms your spirit. It’s no wonder Golf Digest has named Sycamore Ridge the number-one course in Kansas City year after year and Zagat has added the course to its list of the finest in the United States. Sycamore Ridge is golf at its very best.

## 6. Prairie Highlands Golf Course

The par 72, 7,100-yard golf course was designed truly with the golfer in mind. Following the traditions of the game, the course was designed to be walkable, with short distances from green to tee. Fundamental strategies and abundant shot making opportunities are complimented by pristine zoysia fairways and bent grass greens. Four tee boxes play from 7,100 yards from the back tees, to 5,100 yards from the front tees. Errant tee shots will likely find manicured rough or one of 60 strategically positioned sand bunkers, which makes saving par truly rewarding and a birdie nearly heroic. Only deft putting on subtly contoured bent grass putting greens rewards pinpoint accuracy off the tee
