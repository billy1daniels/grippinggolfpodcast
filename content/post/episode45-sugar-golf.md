## Sugar Golf
Island Par 3s … that’s where this story begins. In a scenario every experienced golfer knows well, Sugar Golf constantly found themselves reaching for the worst ball in our bag when they encountered a pond, lake, or fairway stream. They love playing with quality golf balls, but their hearts and pockets would ache when they, all too often, chunked a high-end ball into the drink.

They began to ask themselves why their favorite brands — you know the ones — charge them a fortune, then go on to pay Tour players millions to wear their apparel. What if they passed those profits on to the golfer and sold a quality golf ball that wasn’t priced as a luxury item? What if they could afford to attack every green with the confidence and consistency only a quality ball provides? 

They hit the drawing board and spent their nights, weekends, and savings building a company focused on bringing the most value to the golf community. They stripped out all the fluff that golfers typically encounter with their competitors — Tour sponsorships, overzealous branding, traditional packaging, retail partners, and price padding on shipping costs. 

What emerged was a premium golf ball with a urethane cover and three-piece construction, delivered to customers via 2-day shipping in a convenient bulk mailer containing 27 balls for a straight-forward price of $69.

At last, a premium golf ball that they can afford to play and afford to lose.
