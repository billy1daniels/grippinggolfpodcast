## Maureen Farrell, Coach Mo

Maureen obtained her PGA Class A Membership in 2009, holds a [Titleist Performance Institute (TPI)](https://www.mytpi.com/) Golf Level 3 Certificate and is a U.S. Kids Certified Coach. Maureen’s passion is teaching the game and helping others learn and enjoy the game she loves so much.

Coach Mo doesn't believe in a perfect golf swing, she feels it is her job to help each individual find their own swing or improve upon what they already have; then working toward making a consistent movement which makes them the most successful at impact.

Maureen works with all skill levels and ages, she believes everyone can improve no matter where they are in their golf career. She believes her knowledge of how the body functions sets her apart from other instructors and her holistic approach to the game. Every person has a different lifestyle and commitment level to the game and all of those factors play into her approach in helping you reach your goals. Maureen will help you find what works for you and your golf game and hopefully you will have fun doing it!

Coach Mo’s impressive career stops include: [Carnoustie Golf Links](https://www.carnoustiegolflinks.com/) in Scotland, [Pinehurst #2](https://www.pinehurst.com/golf/courses/no-2/) in North Carolina, [Kansas City Country Club](https://kccc.com/), [Wilderness Ridge Golf Club](https://www.wildernessridgegolf.com/) in Nebraska, and [Blue Hills Country Club](https://www.bluehillscc.com/) in Kansas City.

Maureen serves on the Midwest PGA Foundation Board as well as the 810 Radio “Sharewaves” Foundation Board to help promote the growth of Youth Sports in the Greater KC area. 

She has had the opportunity to speak for the Inaugural Life Fitness/TPI Summit in Oceanside, CA as an industry leader in her field. She also guest writes for the local Tee Times magazine. 

When Maureen is not working she loves to spend time outdoors with her son Matthew and chocolate lab Scout!
