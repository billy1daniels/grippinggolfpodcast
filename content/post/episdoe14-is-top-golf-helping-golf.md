## What is Topgolf?

[Topgolf](https://topgolf.com/us/), your premier entertainment destination. And by entertainment destination, they’re talking about a place where you can come for birthday parties, bachelor or bachelorette parties, corporate events, date nights, or just a night out with friends, and everyone will have a great time.

No matter the occasion or who you share it with, they believe that every great time starts with play, is fueled by food and drinks, moved by music and all made possible through community.

There’s no pressure to have a good golf swing or score a lot of points. It’s all about everyone having fun.

At Topgolf, they’ve made socializing a sport through a blend of technology and entertainment – and that’s just the game! If you journey through one of their venues on any given day, you’ll find a place buzzing with energy. Every Topgolf features dozens of climate-controlled hitting bays for year-round comfort with HDTVs in every bay and throughout our sports bar & restaurant.

When it comes to their eats, they know that amazing food and beverage is at the heart of any great social gathering. They take it pretty seriously. That’s why within each Topgolf restaurant, you will find an accomplished Executive Chef and experienced team, using high-quality ingredients to deliver a fresh twist on familiar favorites. The way they see it, they’re not just a place to play, they’re one of the best places to eat in any city.

If you’re looking for things to do in your area, there are plenty of places to go to – but if you’re looking for something to truly experience, look no further than Topgolf.
