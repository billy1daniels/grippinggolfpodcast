THE FASTEST WAY TO LOWER SCORES
MOST PUTTING MATS ARE TERRIBLE. THEY’RE BUMPY AND WRINKLY AND UGLY… NOTHING LIKE PUTTING ON A REAL PUTTING GREEN.

WE THOUGHT WE COULD DO BETTER, SO WE WORKED WITH TOUR PLAYERS AND TOP GOLF COACHES TO CREATE A PUTTING MAT THAT ROLLS PURE, LOOKS GREAT, AND HAS FEATURES THAT WILL IMMEDIATELY LOWER YOUR SCORES.

IT’S TRUE THAT OUR PERFECT PUTTING MATS COSTS A LITTLE MORE THAN THE REST. BUT THEY’RE GOING TO SAVE YOU A LOT OF HEADACHES ON THE GREEN. AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT’S WORTH. 


TWO HOLE SIZES
You'll never get bored with our two hole sizes: regulation and reduced.


AUTO BALL RETURN
Life is busy. Our Integrated Auto Ball return helps speed things up. It sends your putts back to you quickly -- make or miss-- so you can putt again.


TRAIN TRACK ALIGNMENT
If you've ever used a putting string on the green, you know how much it helps. We brought the same concept to our putting mats with Train Track Alignment that helps you improve your stroke and your alignment.


CRYSTAL VELVET TRUEROLL TECHNOLOGY
On our mats, there is no skipping or skidding with our Crystal Velvet Trueroll Technology. They roll at 10-14 on the stimpmeter speed depending on the underlying surface (hard floors are faster than carpet).
