## Evolution CBD
Evolution CBD was founded in 2016 as a premium CBD offering for mass retail.  Our founding team has more than two decades of combined experience.  Famous in the industry for releasing the world’s first water soluble CBD product, we continue to build on our success to provide customers with more options.  We place customer care above all else and continue to provide the best science, the best technology, and the best manufacturing available in the industry.

From seed-to-sale, we set a standard of excellence in the hemp industry. Evolution CBD exhibits the highest quality at every stage of our product creation. We use only all natural, full-spectrum, terpene-rich hemp oil extract from industrial hemp.

Evolution CBD sets the standard for quality and transparency in this evolving industry.  From top-shelf CBD oils, capsules and gummies to CBD-infused topicals and CBD pet products, customers remember the brand that continuously provides them with the quality goods -- with consistency -- and offers them with a high-level of professionalism.

Transparency is paramount in this industry.  Our Evolution CBD product line contains the highest quality CBD oil available. Evolution’s hemp contains high amounts of cannabidiol from the 100% natural-pure ethanol extraction process. None of our products contain heavy metals nor insecticides. All are 100% gluten free, and non-GMO. All of our hemp oil is batch tested with ultra-performance convergence chromatography.

Before any batch of product is permitted to shelves, it is tested by a third-party lab and the lab results from those tests are available to scan (via a QR code) located on the product packaging.
