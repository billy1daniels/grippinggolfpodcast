## Setting Goals for 2020 and Beyond

### 1. Set Goals That Motivate You
   There's nothing more deflating than setting a goal that your not excited about. Take your time and make sure your goals are something you are passionate about.

### 2. Set SMART Goals
   You probably already heard about SMART goals, and as cliche as they are, they work! Being specific in your goal setting is a great way to ensure you'll accomplish majority of them. Below is a quick guide to setting SMART goals for your golf game.
   #### Set Specific Goals
   Your goals need to be clear and well defined. Without specificity it will be hard to measure or understand if you actually accomplished your goals.
   #### Set Measurable Goals
   Your goals must be quantifiable in amount and in time. Set desired dates in which to accomplish your goals or steps for incremental gains to your macro vs micro goals.
   #### Set Attainable Goals
   Make sure its possible to accomplish your goals. If your goals are far-fetched, you won't be able to enjoy the best part of goal setting, the celebration!
   #### Set Relevant Goals
   Your goals should be relevant to where you want to take your golf game. Setting small goals which are not part of your overall golf goal are a waste of time.
   #### Set Time Bound Goals
   Your goals must have a deadline. Create smaller goals to focus on each month or quarter of the year. These smaller goals should help you accomplish your macro goals.

### 3. Set Goals in Writing
   The act of sitting down writing out your goals makes them real and tangible. You'll have no excuse for forgetting them in a month or two. Also, be sure to use words like "will" instead of "would like." Post your goals in a visible location to help you remember to keep working toward them.
### 4. Make An Action Plan
   You need to avoid getting too focused on the outcomes. Make sure you set a plan on how you are going to accomplish each goal. Set aside time to review your progress each month or quarter depending on how its going to take you to accomplish each goal.
### 5. Stick With It!
   Remember, goal setting is an ongoing activity. Build in reminders and checkpoints to make sure you are staying on top of your goals.
